[2025-11-22 16:52:38] AI: Hi Chang, nice to meet you too. To start, can you describe your approach to finding the median of two sorted arrays, and what the time complexity of that approach would be?


[2025-11-22 16:52:58] User: Um here's my answer right here do you think this looks like this makes sense or do you think there's something off about it

[2025-11-22 16:52:59] AI: This code is functionally correct, but the `sorted(nums1 + nums2)` operation has a time complexity of O(m+n log(m+n)), where m and n are the lengths of the input arrays. Can you think of a way to achieve the same result with a better time complexity, perhaps closer to O(log(min(m, n)))?
