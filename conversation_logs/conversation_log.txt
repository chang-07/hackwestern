[2025-11-22 23:58:29] AI: I'm doing well, thank you for asking! Please share your code for the Two Sum problem when you're ready.

[2025-11-22 23:58:39] User: Yeah for sure Um do you mind walking me through the problem first

[2025-11-22 23:58:42] AI: Certainly. Given an array of integers and a target sum, your task is to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target, and return their indices. Does that make sense?
