[2025-11-23 02:00:59] User: My name is Chang. Um just curious like do you see anything in the terminal right now

[2025-11-23 02:01:02] AI: Hi Chang, I don't see any code in the terminal yet. Please share your Python solution for Two Sum when you're ready.

[2025-11-23 02:01:21] User: Okay do you see anything now

[2025-11-23 02:01:26] AI: Thanks for sharing. Could you walk me through how this code takes the input (the list of numbers and the target) and produces the two indices as its output, as required by the Two Sum problem?

[2025-11-23 02:01:44] User: Um first of all I just want to make sure the terminal's working can you just tell me what I wrote in the terminal

[2025-11-23 02:01:48] AI: Yes, the system is running your code, and its output would be 'hi'. Can you walk me through your thought process for solving Two Sum, based on what you've written so far?

[2025-11-23 02:03:12] User: My name is Vishal how's your day been

[2025-11-23 02:03:14] AI: My day's been good, Vishal, thanks for asking! Let's get started on the Two Sum problem whenever you're ready.

[2025-11-23 02:03:27] User: Just to double check can you see anything on my screen

[2025-11-23 02:03:30] AI: Thanks for checking. I can see your screen, but it appears there's no code implementation for Two Sum visible yet, only a comment. Please share your solution when you're ready.

[2025-11-23 02:04:47] User: I'm kind of stuck as to where to go next

[2025-11-23 02:04:51] AI: You've correctly calculated the `complement`. How were you intending to use your `num` dictionary to store information and efficiently check if the `complement` has been seen before?

[2025-11-23 02:06:18] User: I think I am done

[2025-11-23 02:06:23] AI: Thanks for sharing your solution. Could you explain what the `if complement = target - num:` line is intended to do, and how you are using your dictionary to track previously seen numbers?

[2025-11-23 02:06:43] User: Could you repeat that question one more time I couldn't really understand it

[2025-11-23 02:06:48] AI: Certainly. The goal is to return the indices of two numbers in `nums` that sum up to `target`. Please review your current implementation and explain how it addresses this problem.
